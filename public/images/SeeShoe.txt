Chuck Taylor All Star Low Top
It started when we took scissors to our original High Top Chucks, turning them into low top basketball shoes. Then the sneaker escaped the court for the streets, cementing its status as an everyday icon. What’s next for the Low Top Chucks is up to you. They’re versatile, classic and entirely yours to wear any way you want, anywhere you want, anytime you want. We just make the shoe. You make the stories.

Chuck Taylor All Star High Top
We could tell you that it’s the OG basketball shoe, created over 100 years ago. Or that the design has largely stayed the same, because why mess with a good thing. Or how it became the unofficial sneaker of all your favorite artists and musicians, who each made it their own. Yeah, we could share a lot of stories, but the one that matters most isn’t ours—it’s yours. It’s how and where you take your Chucks. The legacy is long, but what comes next is up to you. We just make the shoe. You make the stories.
